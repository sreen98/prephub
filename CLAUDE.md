# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for Claude Code

## What is this project?
PrepHub is an interview preparation web app. It renders markdown study guides as a modern React site with interactive features (quiz, playground, spaced repetition, interview simulator). Hosted on GitHub Pages as a static PWA — no backend, all state in localStorage.

## Repository layout
- `/web/` — the React web app (this is where all code lives)
- Root-level markdown folders (`Back End/`, `Front End/`, etc.) — source content, copied to `web/src/content/` at build time by `web/scripts/prepare-content.js`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — CI/CD to GitHub Pages

## Build & run
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # local dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build        # production build → web/dist/
```
Build must pass before pushing. The deploy workflow runs `prepare-content.js` then `npm run build`.

## Architecture decisions

### Single-file vs multi-file
- `App.jsx` is large (~1200 lines) because it contains the layout, sidebar, ContentPage, HomePage, and several inline components (ReadingProgress, PreBlock, TableOfContents, MobileToc, SearchModal, BackToTop). Larger features get their own files in `components/`.
- Hooks follow a consistent pattern: useState + localStorage read/write + callback functions. See `useDarkMode.js` as the canonical example.

### Data flow
- `data.js` exports `menuStructure` (defines all guide categories/items), `contentFiles` (eager glob of all markdown), and utility functions. This is the single source of truth for content structure.
- `cheatSheets` array in `data.js` defines cheat sheet routes separately from guide categories.
- All question extraction happens via `extractQuestions()` which parses two markdown patterns (JS output-style `## QN` and standard `**QN: text**`).

### Content
- Markdown files in `web/src/content/` are loaded at build time via `import.meta.glob` with eager loading. They're bundled into the JS, not served as separate files.
- Mermaid diagrams use ` ```mermaid ` code blocks in markdown. The `MermaidBlock` component lazy-loads the mermaid library.
- The `prepare-content.js` script copies root-level markdown to `web/src/content/` with directory name transforms (e.g., "Back End" → "back-end").

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS with custom prose styles in `index.css` (not the @tailwindcss/typography plugin).
- Code blocks always use dark theme (`#22272e` background) regardless of light/dark mode.
- The Code Playground uses a fully dark IDE theme in both modes.

### Key patterns
- **Heading IDs**: `createHeading` in ContentPage generates IDs via `slugify(getTextContent(children))`. Used by TOC, deep links, and bookmarks.
- **Code blocks**: `PreBlock` wraps all `<pre>` elements, adds copy/try-it buttons. Mermaid blocks are detected by `language-mermaid` class and routed to `MermaidBlock`.
- **JSX in Playground**: Detected via `/<[A-Z]/.test(code) || /render\s*\(/.test(code)`. Transpiled by lazy-loaded `@babel/standalone`. React scope injected via `new Function(...keys, code)(...values)`.
- **Spaced Repetition**: SM-2 algorithm in `useSpacedRepetition.js`. Quality 4 = "Got It", 1 = "Study Again".

### localStorage schema
All persistence is in localStorage. Key schemas are documented in README.md. Important: never store sensitive data — this is a public study tool.

### What NOT to do
- Don't add a backend. Everything must work as a static site on GitHub Pages.
- Don't use `@tailwindcss/typography` — prose styles are custom in `index.css`.
- Don't import `Github` from lucide-react (it doesn't exist in this version) — use the inline `GithubIcon` SVG component.
- Don't make the Code Playground light-themed — it's intentionally always dark like an IDE.
- Don't add new dependencies without considering bundle size. Lazy-load heavy libs (mermaid, babel) via dynamic `import()`.

### Deployment
- Base path is `/interview-prep/` (configured in `vite.config.js` and BrowserRouter basename).
- PWA configured via `vite-plugin-pwa` with `autoUpdate` registration.
- Icons in `web/public/` (pwa-192x192.png, pwa-512x512.png).

### Testing
There are no automated tests. Verify changes by:
1. `npm run build` must succeed
2. `npm run dev` and manually check the affected feature
3. Check both light and dark mode
4. Check mobile responsive layout
